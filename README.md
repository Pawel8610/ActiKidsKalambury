# ActiKidsKalambury
Kind of kalambury game. This app was publish to Google Play(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fgamesteam.free1.actikids). I've removed some parts (f.e. id ads from AdMob, graphics, images)
TODO:
0. Improve scalability graphics on large screens - such as tablet (was improved in test version, now is testing and waiting to implementation in this version)
1. Add logger.
2. Add adnotation for JavaDoc.
3. Catch more Exceptions (I leave some empty catch blocks because of 0 ANR - so far) (ANR - Android not response).
4. Use Checkstyle to improve readability my code.
5. Decrease legacy code (translate name of fields, methods to english and according with general rules).
6. Add testing classes using JUnit
